**How many Vine reviews were 5 stars?**
48 Vine reviews were 5 stars.

**How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**
15,663 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

51.06% of Vine reviews were 5 stars.

**What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

## Summary
There may be evidence of positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. This can be judged by the fact that the percentage of five star paid reviews is about 12% higher than the percentage of five star non-paid reviews. To be more certain of this assessment, a t-test should be performed to assess the statistical significance.
